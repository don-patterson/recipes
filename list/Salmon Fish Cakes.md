## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup mashed potatoes
  - i.e. cook/mash potatoes with some garlic and sour cream if available, and reserve 1/2 cup for the fish cakes
- 2 green onions
- large can of salmon (~200g)
- 15 crushed Breton crackers (or 20 crushed regular crackers, 64g)
- 1 egg

## Directions
- Mix up the ingredients and form 4 patties by hand
- fry in a generously oiled pan until golden brown (just a couple minutes on each side)

### Comments
- We added fresh dill once, when we had it on hand. It was quite nice.
- Using the bbq mats, you can grill them for about 4 minutes per side and they come out awesome.
