Inspired by [this recipe](https://theforkedspoon.com/chicken-cacciatore-recipe/). We serve this over mashed potatoes, but I imagine it's fairly versatile.

## Ingredients
- 2-3 chicken breasts
- 1 medium onion
- 2 medium carrots
- 3 stalks celery
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced 
- 3 roma tomatoes (or 2 beefsteak, etc), diced
- 1/2 cup red wine (or 1/4 cup red wine vinegar)
- ~1 cup chicken broth
- ~2 tbsp Italian seasoning

## Directions
1. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with Italian seasoning and sear for about 4 minutes on each side, and set aside
2. Dice the onion, carrots, celery and fry in oil for 5 minutes in the same pan
3. Add the minced garlic to the pan, stir for a minute
4. Add the wine and simmer until it's reduced to half
5. Add the semi cooked chicken, tomatoes, broth, and Italian seasoning
6. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes, until the chicken is fully cooked
