Inspired by [this recipe](https://theforkedspoon.com/chicken-cacciatore-recipe/).

## Ingredients
- 2-3 chicken breasts
- 1 medium onion
- 2 medium carrots
- 3 stalks celery
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced 
- 2 tomatoes, diced
- 1/2 cup red wine
- ~1 cup chicken broth
- ~2 tbsp Italian seasoning

## Directions
1. Sear the chicken breasts for about 4 minutes on each side
2. Dice the onion, carrots, celery and fry in oil for 5 minutes in a separate pan (or same, with chicken set aside)
3. Add the minced garlic to the pan, stir for a minute
4. Add the wine and simmer until it's reduced to half
5. Add the semi cooked chicken, tomatoes, broth, and Italian seasoning
6. Cover and simmer for 15+ minutes, until the chicken is fully cooked

Probably serve this with pasta, but we tried it with mashed potatoes and it was quite good too.
