## Ingredients
- 400g cups shell pasta (or ~4.5 cups, uncooked)

  - 1 tsp dill
  - 1 tsp celery seed
  - 1/2 tbsp pepper


## Directions
1. Boil pasta el dente as per package directions. Drain and blast with cold water to stop cooking, and make sure it's drained again. Pour pasta into a large mixing bowl and set aside
1. Make the dressing: In a medium bowl, mix together the: mayo, sour cream, pickle juice, dill, celery seed, and pepper. 
1. Add the pickles, cheese and green onion to the pasta and mix. Add in the dressing and mix to coat. 
1. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours at minimum. Serve cold and enjoy! 

## Notes:
We found it could use even more dill flavour (juice, dill, and/or pickles) so I'll try that next time and update the recipe
