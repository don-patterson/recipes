## Ingredients 
- 3 egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- ¼ teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 dash Tabasco
- ½ cup butter

## Directions 
1. Mix yolks, lemon juice, mustard, and Tabasco in a container meant for the immersion blender
1. Heat the butter in the microwave for about 1 minute
1. Pour the super hot butter slowly into the mixture while blending, 15-30 seconds

## Notes
- add fresh dill before blending for a nice variation
- don't overdo it with the Tabasco...the vinegar can take over
