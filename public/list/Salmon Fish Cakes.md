### Comments
- We added fresh dill once, when we had it on hand. It was quite nice.
- Using the bbq mats, you can grill them for about 4 minutes per side and they come out awesome.
- Verified substitutes for green onion: 
  - dice and fry 1/2 a small regular onion in butter, and add some spinach near the end
  - dice a leek and fry in butter
